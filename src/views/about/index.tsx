In the vast expanse of the Solana galaxy, a new star was born: SolarMoon, the first-ever deflationary token. Thanks to a neat little upgrade called ‚ÄúToken-2022‚Äù, this bad boy is revving its engines and preparing for a moonshot. Why $MOON? Well, isn't it obvious? We're not just going to the moon; we're owning it! We own the TLD on Solana '.moon' and use our rev share from domain sales to buy back $MOON.";

As we burn through the space (and tokens), the rarity of SolarMoon goes up - simple intergalactic economics. With a community that's growing faster than light speed and the sturdiest tokenomics this side of the Milky Way, our burnt tokens enter a black hole, never to be seen again.";
